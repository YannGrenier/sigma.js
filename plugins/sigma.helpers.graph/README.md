**adjacentEdges( *string* )** : *array*
 * This methods is used to retrieve the adjacent edges of a specified node from the graph. The method must be called with the ID of a node.

**hoverNode( *string, ?boolean* )** : *graph*
 * This methods is used to set the `hover` attribute of a node. The method must be called with the ID of a node, and optionally a boolean value of the `hover` attribute. To hover the node, call `hoverNode(id)`. To un-hover the node, call `hoverNode(id, false)`.
 * The method returns the graph instance.

**hoverEdge( *string, ?boolean* )** : *graph*
 * This methods is used to set the `hover` attribute of an edge. The method must be called with the ID of an edge, and optionally a boolean value of the `hover` attribute. To hover the edge, call `hoverEdge(id)`. To un-hover the edge, call `hoverEdge(id, false)`.
